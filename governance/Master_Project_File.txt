# Master Project File — Note Compacter

## Stage Status Summary
Stage 1 (Environment & Storage Baseline) — COMPLETE and VERIFIED on Windows.  
Electron + Vite baseline creates userData\data and writes stage1.marker.json.  
IPC preload bridge verified.

Stage 2 (Core Project Operations) — COMPLETE and VERIFIED on Windows.  
App supports multiple projects, copy-on-ingest of .txt files, editable master.txt with durable saves, export to .txt, and safe project deletion.  
Two-pane UI implemented (project list + editor).  

## Platform Scope
This project is **Windows-only** by owner directive.  
All paths and commands assume Windows. macOS and Linux are out of scope.

## Architecture Snapshot
Main process handles all file I/O in `electron/storage.js` under `%APPDATA%\Note Compacter\projects\<id>` with subfolder `components\` and files `master.txt`, `project.json`, `ui.json`.  
Preload exposes IPC APIs: `listProjects`, `createProject`, `readMaster`, `saveMaster`, `ingestFiles`, `exportMaster`, `deleteProject`, `getStorageInfo`.  
Renderer provides a two-pane layout with toolbar and in-app modal for project naming.

## Verification Snapshot
Both stages executed on Node v22.20.0, npm 10.9.3, Electron 31.4.0, Vite 5.4.10.  
Results: PASS — no defects blocking progression to Stage 3.

## Next Planned Stage
Stage 3 (Usability & Presentation Enhancements): templated master banners, component list panel, light color theme, and readability improvements.  
Execution pending plan approval.
