# Supplemental Instructions — Note Compacter

===== ADDENDUM — 2025-10-31 — Windows-Only Execution Rules =====
All build, run, and verification steps are Windows-focused. Do not generate macOS/Linux guidance.
Keep versions pinned as verified:
- Node.js v22.20.0
- npm 10.9.3
- Electron 31.4.0
- Vite 5.4.10

When hot-fixing, prefer minimal patches and preserve this environment unless a version change is explicitly approved.
