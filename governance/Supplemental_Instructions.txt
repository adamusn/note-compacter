# Supplemental Instructions — Note Compacter

## Windows-Only Execution
All build, run, and verification steps assume Windows. Do not generate macOS or Linux guidance.

## Version Pins
Node v22.20.0  
npm 10.9.3  
Electron 31.4.0  
Vite 5.4.10  

## Hot-Fix Guidelines
Apply the smallest change necessary. Preserve versions unless explicitly approved.  
Always re-verify `npm run dev` and a fresh project creation after a fix.
