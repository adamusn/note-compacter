# Enhancement Backlog — Note Compacter

## Deferred / Hotfix Candidates
Modal Focus Trap (Create Project when zero projects) — Tighten initial focus and keyboard event capture so typing always lands in the input on first-open. Target: Stage 4 hotfix or Stage 5.

## Upcoming QoL Ideas
Theme Toggle — Add a light/dark toggle without impacting current dark default; persist preference in `ui.json`.  
Keyboard Shortcuts — Add Ctrl+F to focus search field; F3/Shift+F3 for next/previous match; Ctrl+K for alias dialog when a component is selected.  
Component Open-in-Master Jump — Provide a jump-to-banner helper from a component selection to the corresponding range in master.  
Export Presets — Optional export profiles that include project name, user initials, and short date for standardized filenames.

## Confirmed Completed (for history)
Stage 3: Components panel, banners, theme and layout polish (complete).  
Stage 4: Rename (project & alias), recycle-bin delete/restore, search-in-master, timestamped export defaults, dark theme (complete).
