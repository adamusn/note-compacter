# Project File Map — Note Compacter

## Code Structure
electron\main.js — Electron window creation, storage self-checks, and IPC registration for project, master, component, recycle, rebuild, and export operations.  
electron\preload.cjs — Context-isolated bridge exposing the `noteCompacter` API to the renderer.  
electron\storage.js — Main-process file I/O and policies, including copy-on-ingest, metadata-only rename, component aliasing, recycle-bin safe delete and restore, timestamped export default filename, and deterministic master rebuild using banners.  
src\index.html — Application shell, deep bluish dark theme hooks, toolbar, components panel, recycle panel, editor area, search bar, and a reusable modal for naming, renaming, and alias.  
src\styles.css — Windows-friendly dark theme, panels, buttons, modal layering and pointer behavior, editor styles, and search bar styling.  
src\main.js — Renderer logic: project lifecycle, master editing with auto-save indicator, component viewing and alias editing, recycle listing and restore, search-in-master with next/prev navigation, modal orchestration with hardened focus routing.

## Runtime Data (not committed)
%APPDATA%\Note Compacter\projects\<id>\components\ — Internal `.txt` copies plus optional `.meta.json` with alias/originalName/addedAt.  
%APPDATA%\Note Compacter\projects\<id>\master.txt — Editable master file.  
%APPDATA%\Note Compacter\projects\<id>\project.json — Project metadata (id, name, createdAt).  
%APPDATA%\Note Compacter\projects\<id>\ui.json — View preferences reserved for future use.  
%APPDATA%\Note Compacter\projects\.recycle\<token>\ — Recycle packets with moved files and `manifest.json` for safe restore.

## Verification Map
All files above were exercised during Stage 4 verification on Windows with Node v22.20.0, npm 10.9.3, Electron 31.4.0, and Vite 5.4.10. The app remained fully local-first and offline throughout testing.
