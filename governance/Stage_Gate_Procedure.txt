## Tagging Policy
vS1.0 = Stage 1 baseline  
vS2.0 = Stage 2 Core Project Operations  
vS3.0 = Stage 3 Usability & Presentation  
vS4.0 = Stage 4 Stability & QoL  
Each stage tag is immutable once published. Documentation-only additions use minor tag bumps (e.g., vS4.1) if needed.

## Git Flow
New development starts from `main` into a `feature/stage-X` branch. After verification passes, merge with `--no-ff` back into `main`, push, and apply an annotated tag `vSX.0`. Use hotfix branches when addressing post-release issues that do not alter scope.
