# Troubleshooting Playbook — Note Compacter

## Stage 1–2 Known Resolutions
Vite Error "Failed to load url /main.js"  
Cause: File misplaced under src\src\.  
Fix: Move main.js to src\ and reference ./main.js in index.html.

Dev Runner "spawn EINVAL" on Windows  
Cause: Spawning electron via .cmd shim.  
Fix: Use execFile with resolved electron path in electron\dev-runner.js.

UI Modal Error on "New Project"  
Cause: window.prompt unsupported in Chromium under Electron.  
Fix: Custom modal added in Stage 2 with ok/cancel handlers.

Verification Note: All three fixes validated during Stage 2 exit.
