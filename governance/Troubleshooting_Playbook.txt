# Troubleshooting Playbook — Note Compacter

===== CASES ADDED — 2025-10-31 =====
Symptom: Vite "Pre-transform error: Failed to load url /main.js".
Root Cause: main.js located in src\src\main.js while Vite root was src.
Fix: Move main.js to C:\var\www\note-compacter\src and reference with ./main.js in index.html.

Symptom: Dev runner "spawn EINVAL" on Windows.
Root Cause: Spawning electron via .cmd shim.
Fix: Use execFile with the resolved path from `import electron from 'electron'` in electron/dev-runner.js.

Symptom: Clicking "New Project" throws "prompt() is and will not be supported".
Root Cause: Chromium restrictions on window.prompt inside Electron.
Fix: Replace prompt() with an in-app modal; handlers wired in src/main.js with nameModal, nameInput, nameOk, nameCancel.
