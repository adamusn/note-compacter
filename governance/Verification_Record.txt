# Verification Record — Note Compacter

## Stage
Stage 4 — Stability & Quality of Life

## Environment
Windows 10 Workstation; Node v22.20.0; npm 10.9.3; Electron 31.4.0; Vite 5.4.10. No network required; all tests performed offline.

## Files Exercised
electron/main.js; electron/preload.cjs; electron/storage.js; src/index.html; src/styles.css; src/main.js.

## Test Procedure (Windows)
1. Launch with `npm run dev`. Confirm the dark bluish theme renders, sidebar and editor load without errors.  
2. Create a project. If the Create Project modal does not capture typing on first launch with zero projects, press Enter to create an untitled project, then immediately rename; verify rename persists across reload.  
3. Ingest two `.txt` files. Confirm internal copies appear under Components with original names; open a component and view text.  
4. Set a component alias, clear it, and set it again. Confirm alias displays in the Components list but banners in the master remain driven by internal filename and original name.  
5. Use the search bar to find a term that appears in master multiple times. Step through Prev/Next; verify selection moves and count updates.  
6. Click Rebuild Master to reconstruct content deterministically from components. Verify banners are present and ordered as expected.  
7. Export the master and confirm the default filename includes `<ProjectName>_<UTC-timestamp>.txt`. Open the exported file to verify exact content.  
8. Delete one component. Confirm it disappears from Components and appears in Recycle. Restore it and confirm it reappears intact.  
9. Delete the entire project. Confirm it moves to Recycle with a token entry. Restore it and confirm master and components return intact.

## Results
PASS with one deferred minor defect. All Stage 4 features work as designed. The Create Project modal may not capture typing when there are zero projects; OK/Enter still creates a project and rename works immediately afterward. The defect is recorded in the Troubleshooting Playbook and Enhancement Backlog for a hotfix.

## Evidence
Observed correct behavior for copy-on-ingest, alias persistence via `.meta.json`, recycle manifest-based restore, search navigation inside `<textarea>`, and timestamped export defaults. No original user files modified during any operation.
